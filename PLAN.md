# Wildforge — Development Plan

**One developer. Streamlined process.** No multi-agent orchestration, no heavy rules. Direct edits, commit after each meaningful step, group exports after several milestones (Rytis prefers less-frequent uploads).

**Version:** 0.8.2 (in `native/project.godot`). **Latest release:** build-2. **Wrapper:** `node scripts/agent-workflow.mjs <action>`.

**Working rule:** every change committed + validated with the wrapper (see bottom). Keep README + release current.

## How this file works

- Items are `[ ] open`, `[~ in progress]`, or `[x done]`.
- We review the list one by one. Each item can be **done**, **edited**, or **left** — Rytis decides.
- This file is rewritten to drop completed work; only the active list remains.

## Bugs to fix (new from 2026-10-11)

|### 1. UI offcentered, no visual update — `[x done]`
|Modal panels now dynamically center based on `get_viewport().get_visible_rect().size` instead of fixed `Vector2(220,80)`. Panels stay centered at any resolution.

|### 2. Hero gets way too much XP — `[x done]`
|Changed XP curve from `2 + level*2 + level²` to `8 + level*6 + level²*2`. Level 1 now costs ~16 XP vs 5; level 8 costs ~184 vs 82.

|### 3. Enemies stuck on flat ground — `[x done]`
|Added early return in `EnemySurface.tick()`: regular enemies only use surface climbing when player is >3 units higher. On flat ground, enemies walk via standard CharacterBody3D `move_and_slide()`.

|### 4. Mouse up/down zooms instead of looks up/down — `[x done]`
|Removed scroll wheel zoom. Vertical mouse now tilts camera look angle (pitch). Increased Y sensitivity ×2, pitch range expanded to -.8/.6. Camera height fixed (no longer affected by pitch).

|### 5. Card picker: weapon upgrade not matched to equipped weapon — `[x done]`
|Upgrade cards now show "Equipped: Rank X → X+1" when the upgrade applies to an owned weapon, "New weapon — fills empty slot" or "New weapon — full slot required" for new weapons.

### 6. Chest card icons — `[ ] open`
Chest card icons need a complete visual overhaul: detailed 2D artwork. Not a code fix — asset creation needed.

### 7. Hit indicator makes screen to busy — `[ ] open`
Enemie hit particles should apear only on critical hit on the nenemie

## Done (retained, removed from active list)

- Organic island + minimap, painted ground materials, compact HUD + treasure-reel chests.
- Hunter's Oath encounter, semantic potion/weapon/mobility icons, hero materials.
- Co-op lobby (hero select/Ready), shared flowers, owned damage numbers, bottom-edge damage labels, remote stomp ownership.
- Surface climbing (walls/ceilings/ledges/slopes), configurable controls, group XP/coin merge, Attraction/Repulsion pulses, detailed pause stats, run recap, Eclipse corruption visuals, PARANOIA Eclipse music.
- Bugfixes 0.8.2: dictionary corruption crash, 45° slope gate, corruption stage storage.

## Validation (how to prove each change)

- After edits: `node scripts/agent-workflow.mjs check` (JS + Godot import/parse) then `integration`.
- Feature-specific: `pace-review` (XP/level pace), `capture-ui` / `controls-review` (menus, camera, HUD), `coop` / `coop-feedback` (co-op), `combat-review` (combat).
- Build after several milestones: `node scripts/agent-workflow.mjs build` → `.build-staging/.../Wildforge.exe`, then package with `scripts/package-release.ps1 -BuildNumber N -BuildDirectory <dir> -SourceCommit <sha>`.
- Test new builds in solo and coop. Make and inspect new screenshots.
- Preserve history, saves, logs; delete old builds only with explicit authorization.
